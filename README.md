# 1340 group 114 (Table management system)

## Problem statement	
### Our family-owned deli lacks a table management system. We face a number of difficulties because of this. 
1. Availability of tables
Due to the lack of waiters, we cannot identify and manage vacant tables immediately. As a result, we often receive complaints from customers that the waiting time is too long.
2. Management of seats
Sometimes when a large group of customers come, we cannot arrange tables with suitable size for them in a short time. We have to walk around the deli to find a table for them, which is time-consuming. 
3. No trackable record of customer’s dining time
We do not know how long a customer has occupied a table. Therefore, we cannot identify those who occupied for a long time and politely ask them to leave. As a result, the table turnover rate is low.  
4. Layout of deli
As the deli’s layout changes seasonally, it is hard for us to memorize the new layout, which results in a longer time to lead customers to a suitable table.
5. Limited table size
During peak hours, we have to rearrange customers’ seat in order to maximize table usage. For example, when a group of 3 is waiting, we have to arrange them to share an 8-seat table with another 5 customers.
