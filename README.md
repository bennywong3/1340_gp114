# Problem statement	

 Our family-owned deli lacks a table management system. We face a number of difficulties because of this.

**1. Availability of tables**

> Due to the lack of waiters, we cannot identify and manage vacant tables immediately. As a result, we often receive complaints from customers that the waiting time is too long.

**2. Management of seats**

> Sometimes when a large group of customers come, we cannot arrange tables with suitable size for them in a short time. We have to walk around the deli to find a table for them, which is time-consuming. Also when customers leave, we cannot know which table becomes vacant immediately.

**3. No trackable record of customer’s dining time**

> We do not know how long a customer has occupied a table. Therefore, we cannot identify those who occupied for a long time and politely ask them to leave. As a result, the table turnover rate is low.  

**4. Layout of deli**

> As the deli’s layout changes seasonally, it is hard for us to memorize the new layout, which results in a longer time to lead customers to a suitable table.

**5. Limited table size**

> During peak hours, we have to rearrange customers’ seat in order to maximize table usage. For example, when a group of 3 is waiting, we have to arrange them to share an 8-seat table with another 5 customers.  

# Problem settings

Dining area layout (default setting):

<img src="image/layout.jpg">

Maximum table size: 8

Size of tables available: 2,4,8

Total number of seats available: 70

Number of table for 2:  5

Number of table for 4: 5

Number of table for 8: 5

Number of customers for each entry: 1-8 (our deli cannot handle a group of customers with more than 8 people)

Preferable dining time for each customer: 1 hour, maximum 2 hours

Size of dining area: 2000 sq. ft. with maximum 3 rows X 5 columns (in rectangular shape)

# Functionalities and features	

**1. Navigation menu**

In order to access different functions of this program, it provides a navigation menu for users to choose the corresponding function. The program will constantly print this menu after a action has done.

Below is how the menu looks like:
```
Input the corresponding number
---------------------------------------
1: Occupy a table
2: Release a table
3. Check tables occupied for too long
4. Show current availibility of seats
5. End program
---------------------------------------
Your input:
```

**2. Check current availability of seats**

To tackle problem of 1 (availability of tables), when this program print the layout of the deli, it also prints the current availiable seats of all tables next to the table size. The output of one table will be <table size - curr. ava.seat>.

For example, when there is 6 customers occupying a 8-seat table, that means 2 seats are availiable for this table. 
So, the output of that table will be 8-2.

The program will print the current layout as follows:
```
Current layout:
8-2 8-8 8-8 8-8 8-8
4-4 4-4 4-4 4-4 4-4
2-2 2-2 2-2 2-2 2-2
```
The above layout indicates that there is only 6 customers inside the deli, and they are occupying the 8-seat table in the upper left corner.

**3. Occupy a table**

To tackle problem 2 (management of seats) that occuppying a table is insufficient, when we input the number of customers, this program will automactically suggest a vacant table with minimal enough seats for this group of customers. When the number of customers is 5 to 8, this program will assign the 5 customers to occupy a vacant 8-seat table. If the number is 3 to 4, a vacant 4-seat table will be assigned. If the number is 1 to 2, 2-seat table will be used.

For example, if the input is 5, this program will assign the 5 customers to occupy a vacant 8-seat table. 

If inputs are 3 groups with number of customers 5, 4, 2 respectively, the output will be:
```
8-3 8-8 8-8 8-8 8-8
4-0 4-4 4-4 4-4 4-4
2-0 2-2 2-2 2-2 2-2
```

**4. Release a table**

To tackle problem 2 (management of seats) that we fail to know which table is released, 

**5. Check tables occupied for too long**

# Input/ouput specifications

# Compilation and execution instructions

**1. Makefile execution**

I. Use this command line to compile all files:
 ```
 make main
 ```
<img src="image/make_compile.png">
II. Run the executable “main” by typing “./main” at the prompt

<img src="image/execution.png">

**2. Manual compilation and execution**

I. Use these command lines to compile all files separately:
 ```
 g++ -c time_list.cpp
 
 g++ -c layout.cpp
 
 g++ -c print_layout.cpp
 
 g++ -c occupy.cpp
 
 g++ -c release.cpp
 
 g++ -c file_in_out.cpp
 
 g++ -c main.cpp

 g++ main.o time_list.o layout.o print_layout.o occupy.o release.o file_in_out.o -o main
 ```
 
II. If the compilation is successful, you should find another file “main” in the working directory.
